 Sure! Here are a few common JavaScript array problems that are frequently asked in interviews:

1. **Find the Missing Number**: Given an array containing numbers from 1 to N, where one number is missing, find the missing number.

2. **Find the Duplicate Number**: Given an array of integers where each integer is between 1 and N, with one element appearing twice, find the duplicate number.

3. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value.

4. **Product of Array Except Self**: Given an array of integers, return an array where each element is the product of all the elements in the original array except the current element. You should solve it without using division.

5. **Rotate Array**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer.

6. **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.

7. **Merge Intervals**: Given an array of intervals, merge overlapping intervals and return the merged intervals.

8. **Find Peak Element**: Given an array of integers, find a peak element. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

9. **Move Zeroes**: Given an array of integers, move all the zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

10. **Pascal's Triangle**: Generate Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

These are just a few examples of array-related interview questions. It's important to practice solving different types of array problems to strengthen your problem-solving skills and improve your understanding of array manipulation in JavaScript.
